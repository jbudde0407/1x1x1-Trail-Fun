# 1x1x1-Trail-Fun
Log for Wabash Cannonball Trail "1x1x1" Trail Fun competition
This is my first attempt at Github and creating code for the Wabash Cannonball Trail (WCT) website.  I am trying to create a tool to add to the WCT site for a new idea:  A log for trail hiking with a friend as a way to introduce that friend to the WCT.  This, hopefully, will be fun competitive way to incentivize WCT users to hike\bike the trail, introduce someone new to the trail and build the community of WCT users and Northwestern Ohio Rails to Trails (NORTA) members.
